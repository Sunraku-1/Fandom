        <p class="work_project-description1">The Butterfly Mansion (蝶ちょう屋や敷しき Chō Yashiki?) is the manor that the late Flower Hashira Kanae Kocho, Insect Hashira Shinobu Kocho, Tsuguko Kanao Tsuyuri, and assistants Aoi Kanzaki, Sumi Nakahara, Kiyo Terauchi, and Naho Takada live in. The manor is often used as a recovery base for injured Demon Slayers.</p>
  
        <p class="work_project-description2">The majority of healing at the mansion is done by Shinobu Kocho, though there are also attendants known as Kakushi who run errands and assist in watching over the injured. On top of this, there are others who live in the mansion that are not Demon Slayers, but offer training regiments to facilitate the recovery process and help the injured Demon Slayers reach top condition again. For example, Aoi Kanzaki creates a training regiment meant to help Tanjiro Kamado, Inosuke Hashibira, and Zenitsu Agatsuma recover after their battles on Mount Natagumo.[1]</p>

        </p>
   
         <p class="work_project-description2">The Infinity Castle's range seems to extend beyond its already incomprehensibly large area, as Nakime was able to manipulate Enmu and take him to an unknown town seemingly nowhere close to the castle, even dropping him in place using a supernatural vanishing door.[1] She was also able to transport Gyokko and Hantengu from the Infinity Castle to the Swordsmith Village after Muzan ordered them on a mission there.[2] During the Hashira's initial confrontation with Muzan, upon seeing them close in on him, Muzan gave Nakime the signal to open doors that caused them to fall into the castle, despite their initial location being in the extremely well-hidden Ubuyashiki Mansion. The location of the castle at that moment is transported to an area deep under the ground of a city, far away from where the Ubuyashikis predicted they would be.[3]</p>

        </p>
   
         <p class="work_project-description2">To safeguard the village from Demon attacks, strict measures are taken to keep the place concealed and its exact location is kept confidential. Demon Slayers who wish to visit the village must travel blindfolded, with their ears and noses plugged, while piggybacking a Kakushi, to prevent information from being leaked to the demons. After some time, the travelers are passed from one Kakushi to another. Furthermore, the routes and Kakushi themselves are frequently changed. Even the Kakushi who transport the travelers remain unaware of the village's precise location. Guided by Kasugai Crows, each Kakushi is directed to the next in line, although even these crows are switched constantly.[1]
